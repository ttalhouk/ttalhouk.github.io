*What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?*

Wow I learned a lot during this challenge.  Padding is on the outside of the border, the boder goes around the element and the margin is between the border and object.  If you set the margin left and right to auto the object will center within the border.

*What did you learn about CSS positioning?*

Positioning was very tricky.  Initially I was floating objects, but then they started doing unexpected things.  Using the developer tools I saw that the container went to 0px, so I had to give the container `overflow:auto` to grow it correctly.  I also had to use relitive positioning to move certian objects such as the nav bar to the correct locations.

*What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?*

Text manipulation was fairly straight forward, but the positioning was the most difficult for reasons described above.  

*What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?*

CSS is a powerful tool for manuplating HTML elements.  You can really move arrange the sections anyway you want but you have to check it frequetly (at least initially) to see what each change does.
