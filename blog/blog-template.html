How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I found it interesting to get immediate feedback from someone else, also it was interesting to see the wireframe they made.
Since my pair works on websites in the media, she was able to give me insight on they way professionals layout articles.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

It is a good tool for laying out your thoughts.  It makes it easier when you go to the coding to place the 
high level stuff and keep the nesting in mind otherwise you could get lost when trying to make sure all the
right content goes in the right containers.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

I learned about the Log Line concept.  This is to grab your attention to keep you reading on.  It's also important to
keep things from being to cluttered or you don't know where to focus.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I tought my pair about the nav, article, and aside elements that I had just read about and we discussed why we should
incoporate these into our pages to help when formating and keeping the html easier to comprehend.
