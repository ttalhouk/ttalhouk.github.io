					<h1>Blog Entry Week 5: Ruby</h1>
					<h2>Enumerables</h2>

					<p class="codeblk">This week was a deeper dive into Ruby methods and classes.  One of the main types of methods we are imploying are  
					<b>enumerables</b>.  So now comes the obvious question, what the heck is an enumarable?  Well they are methods associated with sorting classes of objects 
					that have an each method available to them (arrays and hashes).  These methods simplify some common tasks such as sorting and finding information within. 
					In this post I will review one such method in detail.</p>
					
					<h2>Maps (aka Collect)</h2>
					
					<p class="codeblk">So <a href="arrays-hashes.html">last week</a> we learned all about arrays which was great... right?! Well now we have our sweet array, but 
					now what if we want to add to modify each element in it.  Well we could run an each method on it then add code to call each element and do something to it like this 
					for instance.</p>
					
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/ttalhouk/b7f694158c3bf8455b0b.js"></script>
					
					<p class="codeblk">That's ok but by the time the empire doubled it's fleet, the rebels would have already taken out the sheild generators. We can't have that now can 
					we!  What if there was a better way.  Let's try a built in method for doing this type of task.</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Well that's a lot more efficent, isn't it!  Note, <span class=code>.map!</span> perminently changes the array that called it so now 
					the empire has two of everything even if I call it later in the code.  If we wanted the change to be temporary such as just 
					at the print command <span class=code>.map</span> would be used instead, then if I called up the empire fleet later they would go back 
					to only having one of everything.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">There are many enumarable methods that can also be found in <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html">the Ruby Docs</a>.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Did you find any other new methods that are useful?  Send me a message below!  Thanks for reading.</p>
