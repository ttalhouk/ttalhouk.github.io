					<h1>Blog Entry Week 7: JavaScript</h1>
					<h2>Ruby Hashes vs JavaScript Objects</h2>

					<p class="codeblk">This week we dipped our feet in the JavaScript pool. It was a bit jarring when transfering from Ruby but after getting over the 
					initial shock of it there are many similarities.  One of which is hashes in Ruby are quite similar to JavaScrips objects as they both contain 
					keys and values that are accessed by those keys but there are a few differences that are important to keep in mind.</p>
					
					<h2>Hashes vs Objects What's the Difference?</h2>
					
					<p class="codeblk">So in <b>Ruby</b> information can be stored in hashes as a sort of unordered list.  These are useful for keeping data organized 
					in logical ways.  For instance if you are describing your pet, you would create a hash that contains that information like so...</p>
					
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/ttalhouk/27512f50c12424d3a866.js"></script>
					
					<p class="codeblk">So our dog Sparky is defined and has key value pairs that can be accessed by calling the <span class="code">hash[key]</span> which is 
					great.  Whenever we need to access that information we can call it up like that instead of an array which would be just a an index value which wouldn'd make 
					much sense.  However the hash doesn't inherently do anything but Ruby does have many build in methods for iterating through the hash to check for values which 
					is more difficult to do in JavaScript.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">But <b>JavaScript</b> is defined much the same way as Ruby, however JavaScript you can include functions so that they can do things.  Let's 
					take a look at a similar Sparky object in JavaScript.</p>
					
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/ttalhouk/4244b40a409a7e62037b.js"></script>

					
					<p class="codeblk">Good boy Sparky!!!</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Did you find this example useful...  Send me a message below!  Thanks for reading.</p>
