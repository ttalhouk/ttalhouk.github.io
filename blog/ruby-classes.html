					<p class="codeblk">So if you start to learn to code long enough you are guarantee to hear about object oriented programming.  So what does that really imply? 
					Well object oriented programming basically looks at everything as an object, like a ball or an anaimal and then you define what that object can do.  However animals 
					and balls don't really have all that much in common which is why the concept of <span class="code">class</span> is important.</p>
					
					<h2>Gettin Classy</h2>
					
					<p class="codeblk">So <a href="enumarable-methods.html">last week</a> we learned about methods and specifically enumarable methods which define a lot of what our program 
					will do, however we can't really do anything to nothing so we have to create an object.  Using our previous example we can make a ball by creating a ball class. 
					We also want to think about what type of attributes we want to define our ball.  This is done like this...</p>
					
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/ttalhouk/82d5a44c96062349f9f9.js"></script>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Great, we've defined our ball objects which are basically a collection of two variables diameter and color.  But did you notice that funky @ symbol 
					infront of the variables? That made those variables, instance variables.  This allows those variables to be accessed within the class.  So for instance lets say I want 
					to create a method that deflates the ball then I would do this...</p>

					<p class="codeblk">So I hope that was an informative peek at classes and objects. Of course this just scratches the surface, but I hope it demonstrated how to create 
					classes of objects and how to pass information between the class methods and calling them from outside the class.
					</p>
