					<p class="codeblk">This week was an introduction to Ruby.  Ruby was developed as a language 
					that is symantical and designed to simiplify the programming 
					interface. It is an Object Oriented Progamming language and while we didn't delve
					too deaply in to objects so far, are working with how to capture variables and reference them through out the program.  Two of these that are 
					used are <span class="code">arrays</span> and <span class="code">hashes</span>.</p>
					
					<h2>Arrays</h2>
					
					<p class="codeblk">So what is an array? Well arrays are ordered collections of objects such as strings, integers, and floats. Arrays are created 
					using the following <span class="code">array = [ 1, 2, 3 ]</span>.  This can then be called later in the program. For instance lets say you want 
					to use the second value in the array how would you get it?  Well you would get it like this:</p>
					
					<img src="../imgs/arraycall.gif" alt="calling an array position" />
					
					<p class="codeblk">Hmm.. why does calling position 1 give the second value? Well arrays start from 0 of course! Yeah that's going to take a little 
					getting used to, but it seems to me that it could be useful if you were counting down since typically you would count down to 0... Blast off!</p>
					
					<img src="../imgs/blastoff.jpg" alt="take off" />
					
					<p class="codeblk">Arrays have built in methods that can perform useful tasks. <span class="code">.each</span> for instance can iterate through the array one
					element at a time.  You can add to the array by <span class="code">.push</span> which adds information to the back end of the array the method is acting on.  There 
					are many other array methods that can be used as well so it is a good idea to look to <a href="http://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Array.html">the Ruby Docs</a> to find what your looking for.</p>
					
					<h2>Hashes: Not just for breakfast!</h2>
					
					<p class="codeblk">What if I don't know what position position my data will be in how can I find the value I want? Well hashes can help with that. 
					Hashes collect the vaules in key value pairs meaing instead of 1 being in the zeroith position in the array, you can make 1 be in the "zeroith" position! 
					You would do this by creating a hash like this: <span class="code">hash = { "zeroith" => 1 }</span>.  Later in the code you would call it like this:</p>
					
					<img src="../imgs/hashcall.gif" alt="calling an hash position" />
					
					<p class="codeblk">Hashes make information available in ways that can be useful. For instance if your key is something that relates to the value, you can 
					accept user input to find relivent information. Such as a hash that links names to addresses, you can take user input, (a name) and return the address linked 
					to that name. The only thing is that the keys have to be unique.  A hash can not hold two keys with the same name.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Like arrays, hashes have methods associated with them as well.  Hash methods that can also be found 
					in <a href="http://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Hash.html">the Ruby Docs</a>.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Did you find any new uses for arrays and hashes.  Send me a message below!  Thanks for reading.</p>
