					<p class="codeblk">This week we've added styling to our site using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.  So now you are saying "that's great, but what does that mean?"  Well CSS 
					stands for <span class="cap">C</span>ascading <span class="cap">S</span>tyle <span class="cap">S</span>heets and controls the look and layout of an HTML page.  It takes all those tags 
					and gives them some type of styling like <span class="code">p{font-size:72px;}</span> will turn something like <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;</span> into... <br /> 
					<div id="exp">text</div></p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">Pretty cool huh!  Well that's not all. Each element of a page has an invisible border around (though you can use CSS to show the border!) to keep parts of a page from 
					running into each other but you may be asking how can I control the space that this border takes up, well CSS can help with that too through <span class="code">margin</span> &amp; <span class="code">padding</span>.  
					Let's take a look at this diagram:</p>
					
					<img src="../imgs/margin-padding.gif" alt="Margin and Padding diagram" />
					
					<p class="codeblk">CSS is also used to position items on the page and tell the page how other blocks of information 
					should interact with them, like that CSS image at the top.  By using <span class="code">img{float:left;}</span> it told the page to push the image to 
					the left and have all the text wrap around it. Pretty useful to make things flow nicely.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">You can also move blocks around from their default positions by using the you guessed it... <span class="code">position</span> property.  Positions can be relitive 
					using <span class="code">position: relitive</span> followed by <span class="code">top: (N)px</span> meaning move the top of this object N pixels from where it normally would be. 
					Alternatively, using <span class="code">position: absolute</span> followed by <span class="code">top: (N)px</span> tells the page to place this N pixels from the top of the page 
					no matter what else is there!</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">All this can get pretty confusing if your page becomes fairly complicated with many boxes and elements, so I've found that using the the Developer Tools on Google Chrome
					helps you visualize what is acting on what so you can pick the right tool to make you site look the way you want.</p>

					<p class="codeblk">There are many other topics to cover on CSS that I can't possibly cover them all in one post. But if you want to add it there's probably a way to do it.  Any
					 tricks you've found.  Send me an email and let me know.  Thanks for reading!</p>
