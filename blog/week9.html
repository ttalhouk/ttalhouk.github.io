					<h1>Blog Entry Week 9: Reflections</h1>
					<h2>A look back on my Phase 0 experience</h2>
					<h3>April 4, 2016</h3>
					</hgroup>
					<p class="codeblk">Well we made it and will be moving on to Phase 1 next week.  While I'm excited to move on 
					its interesting to look back and see how far I've come in a reasonably short time. </p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">We started by learning HTML and CSS. I had previously only had limited experience building a 
					site in HTML in college when I was working in the computer lab. Since then a lot has changed HTML 5's symantic 
					tags and CSS to style pages was all new to me but enabled me to make the site you see here. While I fully intend to 
					continue to work on improving the look and feel of the site I feel I have a good understanding of what is going on 
					now under the hood. This allows me to look at other pages and have an idea on how it was done, and if not let me look 
					at the source code and understand what is happening.  Very eye opening.</p>
					
					
					<p class="codeblk">Next we moved on to Ruby for logic programming.  Comming from an engineering background this is what 
					really appealed to me. Taking a problem and breaking it down to its most basic steps to complete the tasks intended. 
					I did have a slight programming background with having taken classes in older languages that gave me the basic mindset 
					but learning Ruby's somewhat freeform syntax and learning the basics of Object Oriented Programming was a new concept that 
					intregues me and am excited to learn how to integrate this with applications.</p>

					
					<p class="codeblk">And then we moved to JavaScript. Concepts on programming are the same but JS has it's own unique takes on 
					programming. Classes are out but you can somewhat simulate them with objects you create. Also we got to experiment with dynamically 
					updating HTML using it. This week I've added a little program to tell the reader to have a nice day using the name of the day of the 
					week which I did using JavaScript. Baby steps but it was the proof of concept that I needed to really understand what can be done. 
					As we go I'd like to continue to add this sort of functionality to my site and future projects.</p>
					
					<p class="codeblk">So that's it for Phase 0, but not the end of the road. Phase 1-3 are going to be quite the challenge, 
					but one I'm ready for.  I'll be adding new entrys as we go so ome back soon to see what changes are being made. 
					Thanks for reading.</p>
