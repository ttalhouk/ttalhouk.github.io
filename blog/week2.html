		<h1>Blog Entry Week 2: HTML</h1>
		<h2>The language of the internet!</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>This week we began to code in HTML.  But even before that we had to understand the structure of a website.</p>
		<p>In order to make a website developers commonly go through 6 stages</p>
		<dl>
		  <dt>Info Gathering:</dt>
		  <dd>What is the <b>purpose</b> of the site?  What is the <b>goal</b> of the site?  Who is the <b>target audience</b>?</dd>
		  <dt>Planning:</dt>
		  <dd>This is the sage which the developer will create a site map to organize how the site will link together.</dd>
		  <dt>Design:</dt>
		  <dd>What is the site supposed to feel like?  Colors, fonts, images should be determined to tell a cohesive story and enhance <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>.</dd>
		  <dt>Development:</dt>
		  <dd>Development of the <em>Home Page</em> is done and the shell for all interior pages.</dd>
		  <dt>Testing &amp; Delivery:</dt>
		  <dd>How does the site appear on diferent browesers? Is the site accessible for page readers?  Mobile Devices?</dd>
		  <dt>Maintenance:</dt>
		  <dd>Periodic mainenance of the site is needed to make sure all links and funcitonality is working as updates to HTML and browsers can lead to issues if not maintained.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>During the week we developed site maps and wireframes for our own sites.  This laid the foundation in setting the code for the site development</p>
		
		<p>Once the site was properly layed out, time to add the code!  HTML5 allows for symantic tags to be used.  These create blocks within the page that
		are laid out logicly and the source code can be read easily.  This helps when developing, formatting and fixing bugs in the site.  These also
		improve accessiblity and UX.  These tags include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and many <a href="http://html5doctor.com/">more</a>!</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Personal Reflections:</h2>
		<p>While I've had some experience in the past with HTML and Page Making applictions, getting into the nuts and bolts of HTML5
		was a fulfilling experience.  It was interesting to learn about the development considerations of building a site and the different
		theories on what colors to use, what fonts make good headings or text for readablity and accessibility.  So far the sites are not took
		much to look at but next week we will get into CSS.  This allow us to turn the HTML into what we have visioned in our wireframes!</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading my blog.  Leave me a comment at my email below.</p>
