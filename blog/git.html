        Welcome to my DevBootcamp Blog.  I plan on recapping my weekly progress of what was learned as I continue my journey to becoming a developer.  Week 1 was full of new concepts for me which focused on use of the command line and git version control.

        The command line is the way software developers create and navigate directorie trees, create files as well as other useful features.  This took a while to get used to as I'm familiar with the graphical user interfaced systems for these features, but I can see that useing it can become second nature over time.  Powerful searching tools quickly allow the user to find what they are looking for and even output this information to a file.

        I was also introduced to Git and GitHub.  Git is a way to create version controled directories aka repositories.  These are helpful when many changes are going to be made where you may want to go back to an older version.  Git also allows branching off the main directory to allow work to be done in parallel as well as keeping the main (master branch) pristene.  GitHub is a remote location for the repository to be stored.  This acts as the shared point where the repository can be pulled down locally by users that are linked to it.  Within GitHub and pushed branches can have pull requests made to allow for a review before the changes are pulled into the master.  This all sounds very confusing at first and frankly is a lit bit but by following a regimented workflow it leads to a more safe, and organized software development cycle.  Reading further we've only begun to scratch the surface and I plan to play around with it this weekend to test out more features.

        Overall it's been a good first week.
